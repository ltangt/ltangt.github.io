<p>Hello, I am Liang Tang.  I am a software engineer and researcher in <strong>data mining</strong> and  <strong>machine learning</strong>. I have a lot of interests in applying these techniques to solve real-world problems, such as personal recommendation, online advertising, IT service management and so on.</p>

<p>My academic home page is <a href="http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~ltang002">here</a>, where you can find my published research papers and education background. This website is only hosted for my personal blogs and notes.</p>

<p><strong>Variational method</strong> is an approximation method to compute the posterior distribution in Bayesian learning when there is no conjugate likelihood function. This note is to summarize the content from the variational chapter in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/">PRML</a>.</p></div></body>
