							<b>Comment:</b> This paper investigate the problem of autocompletion of user input. I don't know why it is submitted in 
							a database conference. But Prof. Jagadish categories this paper into query autocompletion. The novelty of this 
							paper is to autocomplete a "phrase" (multi-words), not just a single word. This paper emphasized the efficiency 
							of this autocompletion should be very high, so it develops a suffix-tree to do indexing. I didn't read this paper 
							in detail, since I don't think this paper is very related to database's query.

							<b>Comment:</b> This paper proposed a method to generate the query form from the database automatically. 
							The scenario is that current websites' query forms cannot be satisfied by users' requirements. They develop a method 
							to generate the query forms which can cover more requests of users. The basic idea is to find out the important 
							attributes, and put them into a query form. The importance of attributes are considered as the probabilty of being queried.
							The measurement of the importance is similar to PageRank. It is computed from the schema graph and data records 
							in tables.

							<b>Comment:</b> This paper proposed a method to generate the query form from the database query logs. One of this paper's
							contributions is formalization query form's structure. So that this paper likes a academic research
							paper not just an engineering report. Another contribution is using clustering algorithm to cluster the queries in the logs.
							The similarity of two queries is determined by how many data instances are the same of the query results. The query form is
							generated from the medoid queries of each cluster.

							<b>Comment:</b> This paper proposed a method to allow users to modify the query forms. Traditional query forms of websites
							are static, which may not be satisfied by users. The paper's idea is to let users to customize the query form. The authors 
							give a formalization of the query form's construction. That formalization is also used in their another paper 
							"Automating the Design and Construction of Query Forms" published in TKDE in 2009.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<b>Comment:</b> This paper proposed a way to display the query results in database. They use the k-medoid clustering to 
							cluster the query results, and only show the medoids of data records to represent each cluster. And they also provide 
							"zoom in" operation for users to click in, to see the detail results of each cluster. They call the "zoom in" operation 
							is just the query refinement. In addition, in order to improve the performance of finding k medoids, they bring in a 
							"cover-tree" for indexing the data. But the "cover-tree" was proposed in previous literatures.

							In <i>VLDB Conference 2009.</i><br>
							<div class="commentStyle">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<b>Comment(During reading):</b> Their problems are from information retrieval. The query is the keywords search in IR, not the 
							database's query. The first 3 sections is the introduction of the motivation and challenges of query refinement. 
							The query refinement is the expansion of the query keyword set with additional keywords. The 
							purpose is to help the user to search more useful and meaningful documents. The authors defined three objective 
							functions to quantify the top-K expansions, since there are a lot of possible expansions there. So the rest of 
							this paper is introducing their algorithms to solve the problem of finding the top-K expansions. This paper's 
							application scenario is searching some website's product reviews.

							In <i>VLDB Conference 2008.</i><br>
							<div class="commentStyle">
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<b>Comment(During reading):</b> The motivation of this paper is that current database has complex schema and hundreds of tables. 
							Non-expert users can hardly to explore the data in such database. Web query forms are static, which may be able to 
							handle users' requests. This paper develops a query system called "The Q System". This system combines the keywords
							search with relation query together. I haven't read through this paper. I guess, the idea is, this system provides a keywords 
							search function to find matched data attributes, and then use the matched attributes to construct a query template.
							The query template can be considered as the query form. "The Q System" has been used by other science deparments, 
							such as chemistry, bioinformatics. The authors said their database has more than 300 tables. Those chemists and 
							biologists can only query the database by predefined query forms. However, the query forms are static, cannot 
							satisfy all requirements of them. I think this scenario strongly supports their research works.
