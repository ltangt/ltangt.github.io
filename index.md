Welcome to Liang Tang's Pages		{#welcome}
====================

Hello, I am Liang Tang.  I am a software engineer and researcher in **data mining** and  **machine learning**. I have a lot of interests in applying these techniques to solve real-world problems, such as personal recommendation, online advertising, IT service management and so on.

My academic home page is [here](http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~ltang002), where you can find my published research papers and education background. This website is only hosted for my personal blogs and notes.

**Variational method** is an approximation method to compute the posterior distribution in Bayesian learning when there is no conjugate likelihood function. This note is to summarize the content from the variational chapter in [PRML](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/).
